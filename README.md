# Pacifist Chess Simulation

`🙃 Living person 1`: Have you ever wondered what a game of chess would look like if it were played by two pacifists?

`😐 Living person 2`: What? 

`🙃 Living person 1`: **Exactly!**

`💀 Person 3`: 💀

`😐 Living person 2`: Does that make any sense?

`🙃 Living person 1`: Well, yes! It's probably fun! Or... mostly boring! **Please check out these animations below.**

## Player modes
Simulation actually supports four *AI modes*. Although AI is not the right word here, since there is no smart logic implemented.
It's all random! But with a few small factors taken in mind. We can call it *RandomAI*, if you like.
 - **Pacifist** - Whenever possible, choose _non-capture_ moves! But do prioritize non-capture _checkmate_ turns! The only reason *capture* move could be played is if there is no other possible move to be played - such scenario happens more often when king is in check.
 - **Aggressive** - Always prefer _capture/check_ turns. Only the _checkmate_ turn has a higher priorty.
 - **SemiPacifist** - Pacifist mode where pawns are allowed to capture other pawns. We can call it _promotion party mode_.
 - **Random** - Turn is decided completely randomly from the pool of all available turns.

### Pacifist player vs Pacifist player

In the first game below, **the black player wins with `Qb3#`**.

In the second game below, the game ends in a **draw** (50 move rule).

### Pacifist player vs Aggressive player
We can assume such a game will not last very long.

In the example below, the aggressive player was black, and it won the game in 18 moves.

### Aggressive player vs Aggressive player

Two random AI players that both prefer *capture* turns? Would such a game end quickly? What would be the outcome?

Well. Unfortunately, most games with aggressive players end up with a draw. Too aggressive and too dumb to be able to win the game more often.

### SemiPacifist player vs SemiPacifist player

This mode has some quite interesting stats!

Example #1: The black player wins with `Qg3#` on the 123rd move.

Example #2: The white player wins with `b8=Q#` on the 107th move.

### Random player vs Random player

Two fully random players have the most randomized results. Which kind of makes sense.

Example #1: On the 111th move, this game ends in a **stealmate**.

Example #2: The white player wins with `Qa7#` on the 93th move.

## About
This is how I decided to practice my Rust skills. This small experiment was done for, well, mostly fun... I believe! So enjoy these silly statistics and have fun!

### Dependencies
These two Rust crates below were created just for this project, but now could be reused for something more useful. Less absurd.
